Movie Trailer Website			Version 1.2 					   10/19/2015

GENERAL USAGE NOTES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For general use, simply open the folder containing fresh_tomatoes.html and
open it with your preffered browser. A webpage containing a selection of
the authors favorite movies is presented as a slider with descriptions
of the plot and reasons to watch.


TO MODIFY & REUSE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modifying fresh_tomatoes.py allows the user to customize the HTML and CSS of 
the project. Users that want to do away with the wondeful selection of movies
and genius commentary can modify entertainment_center.py. 

To run entertainment_center.py, python needs to be installed:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

With python installed, cd to the directory where the project folder is located.

Example: cd C:Users/Yourname/Downloads/Project 1

After changes to entertainment_center.py have been made and saved, it can be
run from the command line

Example: python entertainment_center.py 

A new version of fresh_tomatoes.html will be added to the folder and can be run
with your browser of choice. 

Enjoy and have fun!
